The \textbf{main practical result} of the current stage of works in the field of Artificial intelligence is not
only the creation of the next-generation intelligent computer systems ensuring effective interaction in
solving comprehensive problems, but also the creation of a technological complex that ensures the
rapid and high-quality building of such systems. This collection of scientific papers "Open semantic
technology for intelligent systems design" is dedicated to these issues.\\

The development of this technological complex requires solving the following problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item clear identification of the logical-semantic level of intelligent computer systems, which abstracts
from all possible options for the technical implementation of these systems (including the use of
fundamentally new computers focused on their hardware support);
  \item development of an ontology for the design of intelligent computer systems and unification of the
description of their logical-semantic models;
  \item ensuring the platform-independent character of the logical design of intelligent computer systems,
the result of which is a unified description of the logical-semantic models of the designed systems;
  \item use of the methodology for component design of intelligent computer systems, which is based on a
constantly replenished library of reusable components of these systems (reusable subsystems,
knowledge base components, knowledge processing agents, user interface components)
  \item ensuring semantic compatibility of reusable components of intelligent computer systems and
semantic compatibility of these systems themselves, as well as technologies for their design and
support of subsequent stages of their life cycle.
\item Each sc-agent has a corresponding specification,
which is also stored in the same sc-memory as the
constructs being processed;
\item The ostis-system problem solver is treated as a
hierarchical system of sc-agents. Two aspects of
organization of such hierarchy are distinguished:
\item Classes of functionally equivalent sc-agents, which
have a common specification but are realized in
general in different ways, are called abstract sc-
agents.
\end{itemize}
participants in the process of decentralized information
processing [1]–[3]. In modern works it is common to
use the classification of self-organization mechanisms
proposed in the works [12], [13]. The work [1] even
suggests the idea of expediency of creating libraries
of standard algorithms for decentralized computing and
group management of networks of autonomous objects,
including consensus protocols, protocols for leader se-
lection, protocols for contractual networks, auction pro-
tocols, protocols for common intentions, protocols for
information exchange in the interests of maintaining
situational awareness of participants in group behavior,

\begin{itemize}
\item Each class of logically atomic actions corresponds
to a solver component (sc-agent) capable of perform-
ing actions of the specified class;
\item Sc-agents react to various events in the ostis-system
memory (sc-memory) and communicate with each
other only by specifying the actions they perform
in this memory. Direct message exchange between
sc-agents is excluded;
\item Each sc-agent has a corresponding specification,
which is also stored in the same sc-memory as the
constructs being processed;
\item The ostis-system problem solver is treated as a
hierarchical system of sc-agents. Two aspects of
organization of such hierarchy are distinguished:
\item Classes of functionally equivalent sc-agents, which
have a common specification but are realized in
general in different ways, are called abstract sc-
agents.
\end{itemize}
The above principles allow to ensure hybridity, mod-
ifiability of ostis-systems problem solvers, as well as
convenience of their design and evolution [4], [11].
The key difference between the distributed ostis-system
and the internal system of sc-agents within an individual
ostis-system is the absence of a common memory storing
a common knowledge base for all sc-agents and acting
as a medium for communication between sc-agents. In
general, as a means of communication between the
participants of a distributed collective of ostis-systems
can be used [7]:
\begin{itemize}
\item Shared unallocated (monolithic) memory, as in the
case of sc-agents over sc-memory;
\item Shared distributed memory. In this case, from a
logical point of view, agents may think that they
are still working on a shared memory, where the
entire available knowledge base is stored, but in
reality the knowledge base will be distributed among
several ostis-systems and the performed transforma-
tions will have to be synchronized among these ostis-
systems;
\item Specialized communication channels. Obviously,
when solving a problem in a distributed collective
of ostis-systems, there should be language and tech-
nical means allowing to transfer messages from one
ostis-system to another.
\end{itemize}
All of the above means of communication can be
combined depending on the class of the problem solved,
the knowledge and skills required for its solution, and
the currently available set of ostis-systems.
When solving a particular problem by a distributed
collective of ostis-systems, in general the following "orga-
nizational" subproblems related to the organization of the
communication process of the ostis-systems themselves
must be solved before proceeding directly to problem
solving within the subject domain:
The very idea of OSTIS Ecosystem and complex
automation of human activity implies the need for
\underline{self-organization} of agents performing problem solving
within the ecosystem. Currently, there is a large number
of works devoted to the issues of self-organization of
participants in the process of decentralized information
processing [1]–[3]. In modern works it is common to
use the classification of self-organization mechanisms
proposed in the works [12], [13]. The work [1] even
suggests the idea of expediency of creating libraries
of standard algorithms for decentralized computing and
group management of networks of autonomous objects,
including consensus protocols, protocols for leader se-
lection, protocols for contractual networks, auction pro-
tocols, protocols for common intentions, protocols for
information exchange in the interests of maintaining
situational awareness of participants in group behavior,
and many others.

At the same time, the proposed architecture of the
 \textit{OSTIS Ecosystem} has a number of important features in
comparison with traditional multi-agent systems, within
the framework of which the existing self-organization
mechanisms are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Agents in traditional self-organizing systems usually
have rather limited functional capabilities, a small
amount of knowledge about the environment and rel-
atively low reliability. This is especially pronounced
in the works devoted to the so-called "swarm intelli-
gence", where each agent in the system is maximally
simplified, and the number of agents in the system
grows accordingly. In turn, each ostis-system within the OSTIS Ecosys-
tem is a complex computer system with an extensive
knowledge base and functionality that allows such
a system to solve a variety of problems from the
relevant subject domain. The implications of this
distinction are as follows:
\item Traditional self-organizing systems are usually not
considered as hierarchical structures, all agents are
considered as autonomous units within the system,
interacting with similar agents at the same level.
The exception is the approaches to self-organization,
which imply the allocation of special coordinat-
ing agents or agents-arbitrators, whose task is to
control other agents. Within the OSTIS Ecosystem
framework, it is assumed to explicitly distinguish
a hierarchy of agents corresponding to the hierar-
chy of ostis-communities, besides, OSTIS Ecosystem
agents are classified according to the role they play
in the process of collective problem solving, in
particular, corporate ostis-systems are distinguished. The hierarchical nature of the agent system makes it
easy to develop and modify such systems by analogy
with the hierarchical structure of problem solvers in
individual ostis-systems [4], [11].
\item In traditional systems, often all agents of the system,
or at least a significant part of them, may be
involved in problem solving. Taking into account the
complexity of ostis-systems included in the OSTIS
Ecosystem, such a situation is unlikely in the OSTIS
Ecosystem and most often in the near future several
ostis-systems, most often belonging to one ostis-
community, will be involved in problem solving.
\item Traditional self-organizing systems are usually con-
sidered in isolation from the means of represen-
tation of information processed in such systems,
i.e. neither the form of representation of processed
information, nor the semantics of processed infor-
mation are explicitly fixed. An important advantage
of OSTIS Ecosystem and OSTIS Technology as a
whole is the orientation on unified and universal
models of information representation, realized in the
form of OSTIS Technology and a family of top-level
ontologies built on its basis. This approach allows
us to say
